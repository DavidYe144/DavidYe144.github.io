									<h1>ETL Processes using Nifi
										</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Data engineers move and process data. While it sounds simple, actually it is one of the most complex, and
									demanding functions when it comes to the amount of things that need to be done. If we think about the cycle at a high level,
									we're looking at collection, storage, processing, and consumption of that. ETL(extract, transform, and load) is a big part of how we can make wer data useful. 
									<br>
									Take a look of this hierarchy of data needs introduced by Monica Girardi:

									We can see that we go through data collection, through storage, transformations, labeling, optimization, all the way into machine learning and AI. Take another look of where specifically ETL lays between:
									<center><img src="images/nifi_1.JPG" width="90%" height="90%"></center>
									Overall, we have different formats, we have different sources, speeds, granularity, and types of storages. We can see the goal in the last two columns which would be the process of analysis and consumption, and ETL lies in between!
									In a brief word, the goal ofan ETL process is to migrate and transform data from the source OLTP systems to feed a data warehouse and form data marts.
								
																
							<h2><center>Apache Nifi</center></h2>
							<p>Apache Software Foundation came up with an excellent tool that is very well suited for ETL called Nifi. Nifi supports scalable directed graphs for data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic, as well as data pipelines and transformation on the data flowing through that pipeline.
                            </p>

							<p>
							<b>Here are different components of Nifi and their functions:</b>
							<br>
								<b>Connector:</b> A connector links processors together and defines the relationship between the processors, which controls how data flows. Connectors can also link one processor back to itself to create a loop.
								<br>
								<b>Controller:</b> A controller records connections between processes and controls the allocation of threads used by all processes (Taylor 2021).
								<br>
								<b>Event:</b> Events represent the change to a FlowFile while traversing through a NiFi flow. These events are tracked in NiFi repositories.
								<br>
								<b>Flow:</b> The NiFi flow is a process that begins once all the processors are connected and running. During this process, the data is updated, inserted, or deleted in a database.
								<br>
								<b>FlowFile:</b> A FlowFile is original data with meta-information attached to it. It allows you to process not only CSV or other record-based data but also pictures, videos, audio, or any other binary data.
								<br>
								<b>Process Group:</b> A process group is composed of all of the processors and their related connectors, and it includes the exchange of data that occurs between these entities through the use of ports.
								<br>
								<b>Processor:</b> A processor is the NiFi component that is responsible for creating, sending, receiving, transforming, routing, splitting, merging, and processing FlowFiles. It is the most important building block available to NiFi users to build their data flows.
								<br>
								<b>Server:</b> As you learned in earlier modules, web servers are network-connected computers that serve or send information to client computers on the network. The NiFi user interface (UI) is hosted on a web server that “hosts NiFi’s HTTP-based commands and API.

							<h2><center>Movies Data ETL Project with Nifi</center></h2>
							<p>
								In this project, I practiced performing ETL on a database that contains information about some movies by constructing NiFi pipelines that act first on an Excel file and then on a MySQL database. First, I constructed a NiFi pipeline to move the data from an Excel file to a .csv file. Then I will be required to move the data from a .csv file to a MySQL database using a NiFi pipeline.
								After creating a network on Docker for a database server container and Nifi container. We are able to access to the local Nifi server
								<center><img src="images/Nifi_5.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"><img src="images/Nifi_7.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"></center>
								<center><img src="images/Nifi_6.jpg" width="70%" height="70%"></center>
								<br>
								Then we need to transport the csv file to the Nifi container. We can do that via docker container command line interface as well. As we create the first processor on Nifi, we use "getfile" processor and set the source as the data we need.
								<center><img src="images/Nifi_8.jpg" width="70%" height="70%"></center>
									<center><img src="images/Nifi_9.jpg" width="80%" height="80%"></center>
								Then I created and connected the rest of the processors: 
								<br>
								<b>GetFile Processor:</b> Creates FlowFiles from files in a directory by pulling the file use it as a source. You are able to set up a time interval to repeatedly pulling updated data. 
								<br>
								<b>ConvertExcelToCSVProcessor:</b> Consumes a Microsoft Excel document and converts each worksheet to csv.
								<br>
								<b>PutFile:</b> Outputs the data to the destinated folder.
								<br>
								<b>ConvertRecord:</b> Converts records from one data format to another using configured Record Reader and Record Write Controller Services.
								<br>
								<b>ConvertJSONtoSQL:</b>Converts a JSON-formatted FlowFile into an UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE SQL statement.
								<br>
								<b>PutSQL:</b> Executes a SQL UPDATE or INSERT command. The content of an incoming FlowFile is expected to be the SQL command to execute.

								<br>
								From here, we can see we successfully loaded the movie file from xlsx to MySQL Database.
