									<h1>SCCS Daily Bible Reading<br />
										Page</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Bible has been the number one selling book for the past centry. Many people read bible for different things. All kinds of people read bible for their own purpose. Some read it for knowledge; some read it for wisdom; some read it history, and some read it for religion.
                                    But the difficult thing is, the bible is too long! A normal bible that includes the Old Testament, which is before Christ, and the New Testament, which is after Christ, includes 66 books, 1189 chapters, 31102 verses, and 750,000 words! According to Google, it takes 70 hours and 40 minutes to finish the entire bible.
                                    How is it possible to finish this lengthy book? Many Christians were recommended to read three chapters of the Old Testament and one chapter of the New Testament everyday, and they can finish the entire bible in a year. However, it is not easy to track where you have left off, and if you miss a day, you would simply fall off the track.
                                    Personally, I know many people who failed this plan simply because they missed a day and was not able to make it back to schedule! I always thought, wouldn't it be great if there is an app that gives you the verses of the day everyday so you can read it when you are  waiting for your coffee to brew or simply taking a break from work?
                                    My company Southern California Christian Students (SCCS) have produced this app, and we are able to implement a webpage to a tab in the app. I decided to follow my dream by making a page that automatically presents the chapter of the day. So whoever uses the app can go to the bible tab, read the bible and the verses of the day from their phone or tablet. 
								
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/bible_1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								
							<h2><center>Brainstorming</center></h2>
							<p>This page needs to include two sections: A tab with the books of the bibles for regular use, and a tab with daily bible reading schedule. The first one is pretty straight forword by simplying making html files, the second one is much more complicated.
                                So I made a folder called "reading_plan" and put all the verses that needs to be shown in each html file in the folder. Each html file is corresponded to each day of the year with the verses of the day. And I used python to automatically show the html according to the day.                             
                            </p>	
							<p>As you can see, this is how the website looks like in general. You have the general bible on the left, and reading plan if you tap on the button </p>

                            <h2><center>Design</center></h2>
                            <p>For the design, since most users will be using this tool on their phone, I splitted the Old Testament and New Testament, and you can scroll each side to access the book you want. This gives a much cleaner look than most of the bible apps out there, where they either have just one column of all the books and leaving New Testament books all the way in the bottom, or all the books cluster togethere in one chunk. Here are some examples:
                                <center><img src="images/bible_5.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"><img src="images/bible_4.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"></center>
                                <center>Here are the view of the table of contents of the bible from <b>U Version Bible</b> and <b>RCV Bible</b> apps. </center>
                                <br>
                                <center><img src="images/bible_6.JPG"</center>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                I made floating bottons for "Old Testament" and "New Testament" on the top. When you scroll the Old Testament, the only thing that moves is the books on the left side.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <center><img src="./images/bible_7.JPG" width="50%" height="50%"><img src="./images/bible_8.JPG" width="50%" height="50%"></center>
                                <p>
                                Here is the view of the daily reading. It brings you directly into the chapter of the day. When you click the bottom on the top, which here, is "Exodus", it brings you back to the main page.
                                And when you click the chapter, which here, is "Exodus 10", it brings you to this chapter of the entire bible where you can check out the chapters before and after.
                                </p>
                            </p>
                            <center><img src="./images/bible_9.JPG" width="50%" height="50%"</center>
                            <p>
                                Here is the view of it on the app, which is the platform where over 3000 college-age Christians use on a daily basis. I believe this tool can be a huge help to encourage them to read the bible and cause them to grow in their spiritual pursuit.
                            </p>
